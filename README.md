# Ticket Creation Customer Support
Automatic ticket creation for Customer Support.<br>
Run email_full.py to start fetching mail from the server and start generating ticket.<br>
# Our topic focus on basically these particular areas:
- The correctness of the data given to the machine by the end user if the format is in the required order with no problems in it then it - proceeds to the step where the final ticket is being sent else it goes to the next step.
- Also to check if the details given by the user are not incomplete. If no the proceed skipping the next steps.
- If  an error in the given input is detected then it will use the Machine language technique(explained in later slide),or will send back the form to the end user.
- The form sent will not loose its existing data, it will only require required missing data.
- Ticket Generation ticket gets generated with all the required details in a given format and gets sent to the userâ€™s email id.
